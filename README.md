# Project Name:  Bike-Rental-count-prediction-using-Machine-Learning
# Project Description: Firstly I collected the data from  Kaggle and start exploring it then it discovered that there is a lot missing data and outliers also so I 
                       start to resolve that. After cleaning data i tried to find any relation of Bike rentals with the other features given in the data-set. 
                       using scatter plot i discovered that as temperatures increases Bike rentals also increases. But as Windspeed and humidity increases the 
                       Bike rentals decreases. Than I split the data according to dependent and Independent Features and lastly I train the model using Linear Regression.
 # Project Result: model.score(x_test, y_test) = 0.9820623857913312
                   mean_absolute_error(y_test, y_pred) = 194.31620720519675
